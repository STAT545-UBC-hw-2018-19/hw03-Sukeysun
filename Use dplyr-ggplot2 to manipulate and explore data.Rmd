**TASK1 Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.**

According to the table and figure, we can obtain the maximum and minimum gdp per capita for all continents. The figure gives us a perceptual intuition of the differences of the gdp/captia gap. As shown in the figure above, we can notice that the gaps of gdp/capita are very different among the 5 continents and Asia has the largest gap of gdp/capita. 


**TASK2 Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.**
```{r Task2, fig.height=10, fig.width=15}
range_captia <- gapminder %>%
  group_by( continent ) %>% 
  summarize( min_gdp = min( gdpPercap ), max_gdp = max( gdpPercap ),
            mean_gdp = mean( gdpPercap ), md_gdp = median( gdpPercap ),
            sd_gdp = sd( gdpPercap )) %>%  # summarize the basic info of gdp in each continent
  mutate( gdp_range = paste( min_gdp, max_gdp, sep = " ~ ")) %>% # separate minimum and maximum value by ~
  select( continent, gdp_range, mean_gdp, md_gdp, sd_gdp)

#knitr::kable( range_captia )

spreadplt <- ggplot( gapminder, aes( continent, gdpPercap )) +
  geom_boxplot( aes( fill = continent ))+
  labs( x = "continent", y = "gdp/capita", 
              title = "spread of GDP per capita within the continents") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))

rangeplt <- range_captia %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line( aes( x = continent, y = mean_gdp, color = "mean",group = 1 ))+
  geom_line( aes( x = continent,y = md_gdp,color = "median",group = 1 )) +
  geom_line( aes( x = continent,y = sd_gdp,color = "standard deviation",group = 1 ))+
  labs(x = "continent", y = "gdp/capita", 
              title = "spread of GDP per capita within the continents") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))
  
grid.arrange(tableGrob(range_captia),
             spreadplt,
             rangeplt,
             nrow = 2)

```

Except summarizing the spread of each continent by table, we can also use boxplot and line. Boxplot gives us the maximum and minimum values , quartiles and outliers of a group data, but it cannot show the standard deviation of data. From the figures above, Asia has the highest gdp/capita and the highest standaed deviation while Afica has the lowest gdp/capita and standard deviation.


**TASK3 Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.**
```{r Task3, fig.height= 5, fig.width=16}
years <- gapminder %>%
  group_by( year) %>%
  summarize( num = sum( as.numeric( pop ) ),  
            mean = mean( lifeExp ),
            weighted_mean = weighted.mean( lifeExp, pop )) # weighted.mean could compute a weighted mean.lifeExp is an object which mean is to be compute and pop is an numerical vector to compute the weight

#knitr::kable( years )

meanplt <- ggplot( years )+
  geom_line( aes( x = year, y = mean, color = "mean",group = 1 ))+
  geom_line( aes( x = year,y = weighted_mean,color = "weighted_mean",group = 1 )) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "lifeExp", 
              title = "mean/weighed mean of life expectancy for each year") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))

grid.arrange(tableGrob(years),
             meanplt,
             nrow =1)

```

As shown in the figrue above, typically, life expectancy increases with the increase of year. I met one problem when I did this task. When I wanted show the total number of people each year by using sum(pop), I got lots of "NA". Then I googled this problem and found a [helpful link in stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46747986/sum-in-dplyr-and-aggregate-na-values). When we want to sum int, we need to convert it into numeric first.


**TASK4 How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?**

```{r Task4, fig.height=5, fig.width=16}

## NOTICE: a easier way to calculate meanLife1952 is to function first(), 
## but here I just want to reinforce how to use rep() 

meanLife1952 <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by( continent ) %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  summarize( mean1952 = mean( lifeExp )) %>% 
  `[[`("mean1952")



lifeChange <- gapminder %>%
  group_by( continent, year ) %>% 
  summarize( mean_life = mean( lifeExp ))

lifeChange$meanLife1952 <- rep( meanLife1952, each = length( unique( gapminder$year )))

lifeChange <- lifeChange %>%                               
  # compare with the previous life expentancy in last 5 years
  mutate( change_5years = mean_life - lag( mean_life ),
  # compare with life expentancy in 1952       
         change_1952 = mean_life - meanLife1952 )
 
  
## it is really a long table, I would like to only show the first 10 rows
#knitr::kable( head( lifeChange,10 ))   


changeplt <- lifeChange %>% 
  filter(!is.na( change_5years )) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_point( aes( x= year, y = change_5years ))+
  geom_line( aes( x= year, y = change_5years, colour = "change_5years" ))+
  geom_line( aes( x = year, y = 0 )) +
  geom_point( aes(x= year, y = change_1952 ))+
  geom_line( aes(x= year, y = change_1952, colour = "change_1952" )) +
  theme( strip.text.x = element_text( size = 10 , angle = 30),
          strip.text.y = element_text( size = 10, face = "bold" ),
          strip.background = element_rect( colour = "red", fill = "#CCCCFF" )) +
  labs(x = "year", y = "life Expectany Change", 
              title = "  life Expectany Change for each continent  ") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))
  
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( lifeChange, 10)),
             changeplt,
             nrow = 1)
  
```

The blue lines represent the changes of life expectancy every 5 years and the orange ones represent the change of life expectancy compared with 1952. According to the graphs, compared with 1952, the life expectany of each continent has risen. However, when it comes to the life expectant changes in 5 years, we can notice that there are some values less than 0 appearing in the graph of Africa. That is to say, life expectancy in Africa has a negative growth.



**TASK5 Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.**


```{r Task5, fig.height=10,fig.width=10}

### check if the life expectancy of a country is lower than 
### the mean life expectancy of this year

if_lowlifeExp <- gapminder %>%
  group_by( year, continent ) %>% 
  mutate( mean_eachyear = mean( lifeExp )) %>% 
  mutate( less = if_else( lifeExp < mean_eachyear , "lower", "higher" )) %>% 
  group_by( year ) %>% 
  select (year, country , continent, lifeExp, less) %>% 
  arrange( year ) 

#knitr::kable( head( if_lowlifeExp,10 ))


### check how many countries' life expectancy is lower than 
### the mean life expectancy of this year in each continent

count_lowlifeExp <- gapminder %>%
  group_by (year, continent ) %>% 
  mutate( mean_eachyear = mean( lifeExp )) %>% 
  mutate( less = if_else( lifeExp < mean_eachyear , "lower", "higher" )) %>% 
  filter( less == "lower" ) %>% 
  summarize( num_lower = n() ) %>% 
  group_by( year ) %>% 
  arrange( year )

#knitr::kable( head( count_lowlifeExp,10))

##### or use geom_bar to count

ifplt <- if_lowlifeExp %>% 
  filter( less == "lower" ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar( aes( year, fill = continent)) +
  ggtitle( "distrubtion of life expectancy "  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=22))

grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( if_lowlifeExp, 10)),
             tableGrob( head( count_lowlifeExp,10 )),
             ifplt,
             nrow =2 , 
             ncol = 2)

```

In this task, I used two method to count the number of countries which have a life expectancy lower than the mean life expectancy. One method is to use n() and the other is with the help of geom_bar(). According to the table or the graph above, we can notice that each 5 years, Africa has the largest number of country with low life expectancy. But the large number may be based on the large total number of countries in Africa, so checking the percentage maybe more convinced.

**TASK6 Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class**

***According to the last task, we can notice that Africa has the largest number of countries with low life expectancy, but I would like to know the percentage of the countries with low life expectancy in each continent***

```{r Task6-1, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
ncountry <- if_lowlifeExp %>% 
  group_by( continent ) %>%
  mutate( ncountry = n()) %>%
  
  select( year, continent, ncountry) %>% 
  filter ( !duplicated( year, continent) )

newtable <- merge( count_lowlifeExp, ncountry, 
                   by = c( "year", "continent" )) %>%
  mutate(percentage = num_lower/ncountry)

#knitr::kable ( head( newtable, 10))

newplt <- newtable %>% 
  ggplot()+
  facet_wrap( ~ continent , scales = "free") +
  geom_line( aes( year, percentage)) +
  theme( strip.text.x = element_text( size = 10 , angle = 30),
          strip.text.y = element_text( size = 10, face = "bold" ),
          strip.background = element_rect( colour = "red", fill = "#CCCCFF" )) +
  labs( title = ("Percentage of country with low life expectancy in each continent"))
  
grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( newtable, 10) ),
             newplt,
             nrow = 1)
  
```

According to the graph above, we can summarize something interesting. The percentages of country with low life expectancy in Oceania are same in each 5 years. Asia has a sharp decrease of low life expectancy sine 1970 while Africa has a slight increase after the same year. 

***I would like to focus on the differences between Africa and Asia as according to the tasks above, these two continents have a totally different trend sometimes***

Let's go bcak to task 1, when I compared the gap of gdp/capita in each continent, I noticed that Asia has a large gap during the period from 1950 to 2000 while Africa has the smallest gap. I would like to know the increase trend of gdp/capita in these two continents.

```{r Task6-2, fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
Africa_Asia <- gapminder %>% 
  filter( continent %in% c( "Africa", "Asia" )) %>%
  group_by( continent, year ) %>% 
  summarize( mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap)) 


aaplt <- Africa_Asia %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line( aes( year, mean_gdp, 
                  color = continent,
                  size = 0.5 )) +
  labs(title = ("gdp/capita trend of Africa and Asia"))

grid.arrange(tableGrob( head( Africa_Asia, 10)),
             aaplt,
             nrow = 1)
  
```

![](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-Sukeysun/blob/master/pictures/Task6-2-1.png)

We can notice that, generally, Asia has a fast increase of gdp/capita while Afica has a slow increase of gdp/capita. Especially around 1972, both mean gdp of Asia and Africa reached a small peak.
